        <p><h2>About the Project</h2></p>
        <p>
          The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives,
          was established in 1938 to investigate subversive organizations in the U.S. government. By 1945, its focus had shifted to investigating potential Communist activities. HUAC remained active until 1975.</p>
        <p>The HUAC records—over tens of thousands of pages from hundreds of hearings—represent one of the most substantive and largest collections of twentieth century American history, providing
          primary source material on American Cold War history and a unique account of government responses to real and perceived political dissent at key moments in American history.</p>
        <p>Currently, the HUAC records are difficult to locate and only few of the transcripts have been digitized, making it difficult to read individual trials or locate specific people,
          much less search for meaningful patterns. The possibility of using HUAC records for research interests, such as comparative historical political analysis and forensic computational linguistics, remains untapped.</p>
        <p>The Digital HUAC project aims to develop the HUAC transcripts as a flexible research environment for future digital humanities projects by opening the transcripts for data and textual analysis.
          This project intends to create a keyword-enabled, fully searchable online version of a small sampling of HUAC testimony and an API to export datasets for further data, textual, and visual analysis. The final
          product will be easily scalable to eventually encompass the complete HUAC records.</p>
        <p>The Digital HUAC team is comprised of four students at the CUNY Graduate Center: Chris, Daria, Juliana, & Sarah.</p>
